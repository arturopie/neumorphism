- name: Migration to Continuous Deployment
  descr: "This project was a company wide initiative to adopt Continuous Deployment (CD) across all our products. It involved migrating all our apps to use Docker, AWS ECS, terraform,  Buildkite CI, Knapsack, Feature Flags, the 12 Factor App methodology, and DevOps practises.
  I started by migrating one of our smaller apps to use a infrastructure that could handler more frequent deploys, and teach this small team how to follow CD practises. Once the company saw the benefits of migrating all our apps to use CD, I was able to assemble a team we called the Dev Accelerator to migrate the rest of the apps and support the teams in this process change. With this project, the team was able to reduced deployment frequency from 1.58/week to 5/day, reduced the lead time for changes from 3 weeks to 25 minutes, reduced the time to restore service from 14.7 hours to 1 hour, reduce change failure rate from 68.4% to 2.91%. I received the Nulogy Stars Award. the most important company award, after the completion of this project."
